Aim of this project is to enable reservoir computing for .NET without any other dependencies.

Currently implemented:
	Normalizer (data normalizer/denormalizer supporting gausse data standardization)
	Activation functions (Tanh, Elliot, Sinusoid, Identity)
	AnalogReservoir
		(supporting Random, Ring and Doubly Twisted Thoroidal internal connection topologies)
		(supporting Feedback, Context neuron and Retirement neurons features)
	FF/BasicNetwork (Feed Forward Network)
	LinRegrTrainer (Linear Regression trainer)
	RPROPTrainer (Resilient Propagation trainer)
	ESN (Echo State Network supporting multiple internal reservoirs)

Usage is demonstrated through simple demo console application (/Demo/ESNDemoConsoleApp)
